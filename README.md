# Cynthia Ugwu Clone

In this project I have tried to clone a website that was once featured in awards as well. I have used my html, css and some basic (very basic actually ) knowledge of JS in making this site. I have  used Gsap and Locomotive js to  add some sweetness in this project.

"I will definitely improve this clone and add more lines of code after learning js"
